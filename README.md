Created by CJ Greer | 2025

SpaceGame is a fast-paced arcade shooter where you pilot a spaceship through an endless asteroid field while collecting powerups, upgrading your weapons, and fighting for survival. Your goal: stay alive, rack up points, and climb through the levels as the danger increases.

Dodge falling rocks, blast obstacles with your lasers, and snag powerups to boost your health, turrets, and ammo. The longer you survive, the faster and deadlier the space debris becomes — testing your reflexes and precision aim.

Every level ramps up the challenge by spawning asteroids more frequently. Careful shots and quick movements earn higher scores and better accuracy ratings. But watch your ship’s health — once it’s gone, it’s game over.

Features:

Dynamic levels with increasing difficulty

Multiple turret upgrades and laser types

Randomly spawning powerups for health, ammo, and firepower

Scoring system and accuracy tracker

Custom start and game-over screens

Animated stars for a moving space backdrop

Objective:
Survive as long as possible, destroy incoming asteroids, collect upgrades, and push your score to the limit.
